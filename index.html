        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Git is a little bit of a challenge... There are so many ways to do the same thing, from so many different places. Soon, I'll figure out my system.</p>
          <p>Should I use GitBash? GitHub Desktop? The GitHub website? What about Git in Atom? So many options!</p>

          <p>Today has been a challenge, but I've been knocking out challenges! I have made and styled this blog, and even completed an extra challenge to make the posts alternate background colors.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to lie, I had to Google some help. Thank God for Stack Overflow. Asked, and answered! <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38578874/how-to-alternate-background-colour-on-div-rows-jquery-and-or-css" target="_blank">Click here</a> for help using nth-child psuedo-classes. The biggest challenge was to determine which div to target specifically, and <em>**humble brag** </em> I figured it out, all by myself!</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I have a really tough life. I wake up, eat, then nap. There are these human people who live with me that are always bothering me. They think I want to be petted all the time, but really it's only when I feel like it.</p>
          <p>Now, it's time to have a quick 30 second wash. I'll probably fall asleep right here again for a few hours.</p>

          <p>Look at me go! I'm making my own blog, and NO ONE can stop me. Now, I'm on my way to creating a new portfolio piece. For a comparison example of an earlier piece, <a href="https://codepen.io/ShannonCook/pen/XYLobb" target="_blank">check this out.</a></p>
          <p>Sometimes, we need just the right teacher to make things click. I'm starting out simple, and building from there. This really isn't as hard as I've made it out to be!</p>
